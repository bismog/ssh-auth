### Background
I have a cluster with 1-3 of them act as manage nodes. 
For some reason, I need create mutual authorization from these manage nodes to all nodes in cluster.
And I should face the reality that there will be some new borned nodes in the future.


### What-I-Do
A database of Etcd to store all cluster nodes informantion.
Setting up mutual authorization from manage nodes to all cluster nodes automatically.
All cluster nodes have the same default user and password.
After mutual autorization, I will make PasswordAuthentication to anavailable.
So this project is something of auto deployment.
